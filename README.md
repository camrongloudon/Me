- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Camron Gloudon, I'm 15 years old.
-I'm interested in anything and eveything tech. From Coding to Animation to how laser pointers work. 
-I'm currently learning Python as my pain language but was introduced formally to programming with dev Pascal\n
I would like to learn about Networks and Cyber stuff in the near future.
-My main goal in being a programmer is to be the best programmer the wprld has ever seen. #I have no idea how to do this but, I guess i will start with python :)
-I'm still in the learning phase of Python but I would be happy to be a spectator in how groups run and be a part of one.
